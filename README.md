<p align="center">Never tab out of your fullscreen again! 🔥</p>

<h3>🤖 How it works</h3>
<p>StreamChat+ is a possibility to display your whole TwitchChat directly into your minecraft chat with just one simple LabyMod addon. Interact with your viewers, receive stream alerts and talk with your chat in real-time!</p>

<p>All you need to do to start interacting with your StreamChat is to claim your Twitch channel's oauth-Token from <code>https://twitchapps.com/</code>, paste it into the addon configuraton and enter, which channel's chat you want to display into your chat.</p>
<br>
<h3>⚠️ IMPORTANT: Project paused!</h3>
Since LabyMod is planning to release a completely new Addon-Library with the new <b>LabyMod 4</b> it wouldn't make any sense to improve this addon anymore for LabyMod 3. That means, that I'll pause this project and continue it after the release of LabyMod 4.
<br>
<br>
<h3>⚙️ Configuration</h3>
<b>Step 1</b> › Download the addon from the LabyMod addon store. If you want to use an unofficial version, there are sometimes unreleased features <a href="https://github.com/jonas-koll/StreamChat/releases">here</a>. Please note, that you won't receive any support for using or installing unofficial versions.

<br>
<b>Step 2</b> › If you're asked to restart your game, please confirm this to activate the addon correctly. Now head over to the configuration by clicking on the small `⚙️` icon.

<br>
<b>Step 3</b> › Now you can set up everything you need. Make sure that you also have <b>enabled</b> the addon!

<br>
<b>Step 4</b> › To connect your LabyMod client to your Twitch account, please visit <b>this link</b>, log in to your twitch account and copy the generated token from the input field.

<br>
<b>Step 5</b> › Now paste the token into the right field at your addon configuration and enter the channel name above. You're not supposed to enter your own channel. This addon works like an indirect client, so you can also visit and interact with other streamers' chats.
